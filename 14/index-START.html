    console.log(players,team);
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    console.log(team5,players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      social : {
        twiteer : "@dm",
        facebook : "demo",
      },
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const caption = person;
    caption.number = 99;
    console.log(caption.number,person.number);

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:99, age:20});
    console.log(cap2,person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    console.log(cap3,person);
    cap3.name = "dishen";
    console.log(cap3,person);

    const dev = Object.assign({},person);
    console.log(dev);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
